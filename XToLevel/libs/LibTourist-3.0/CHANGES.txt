- The following transports have been replaced by portals:
Orgrimmar - Undercity zeppelin
Undercity - Grom'gol zeppelin
Undercity - Howling Fjord zeppelin
Stormwind City - Teldrassil boat
Teldrassil - Azuremyst boat
- The Zandalar continent has its faction set to Horde

- GetMapNameById now returns the correct name for The Maelstrom continent (ID 948)
- GetLevel now returns nil for 'scaled' (the third return value) if high and low are equal (like for Suramar), as there is not much to scale in a one-level bracket
