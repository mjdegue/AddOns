# **XToLevel**

_All credit goes to AtliThor and eridius_

A simple AddOn that provides details about your levelling progress, tracking a variety of items required until you reach your next level.

## Tracks the following :

- Mob kills and Quests.
- Dungeon runs.
- Battleground runs, as well as individual BG objectives.
- Gathering professions.

## Display Options

- A small, configurable window, showing averages needed to level, a mini XP bar, and a time-to-level estimate.
- A "floating" message and/or a chat message can be shown when XP is gained, to show exactly how many more such gains are required to level.
- A highly configurable LDB data-source, providing data to LDB front-end AddOns, such as TitanPanel and Fortress.

## Configuration

All of these display features can be configured via the configuration panel, which is accessible in the Interface/AddOns window, or simply by typing the commands :

    /xtl or /xtolevel
